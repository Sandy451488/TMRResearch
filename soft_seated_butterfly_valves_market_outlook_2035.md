## What are Soft Seated Butterfly Valves?

Soft seated butterfly valves feature a metallic body with a non-metallic seat made of materials like **EPDM, PTFE, VITON**, or **Nylon**, which ensures tight sealing and vibration absorption. These valves are generally centerline-type with a 90-degree rotation capability, allowing for precise flow control. Their lightweight, low-maintenance design makes them ideal for low to medium pressure and temperature applications.

There are several types of soft seated butterfly valves, including:

- **Wafer-type** (easy to install at any position)  
- **Flanged-type** (suitable for flange piping)  
- **Lug-type** and others  

They are operated manually or through actuators—pneumatic, electric, or turbine-based—and are often used in bi-directional flow systems.
