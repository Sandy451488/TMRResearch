## Analyst Viewpoint

The expansion of oil & gas infrastructure globally is a key growth driver for the offshore welding sector. Welding is indispensable in the fabrication and maintenance of offshore structures made from steel and high-performance alloys. Furthermore, the increasing deployment of robotic welding systems — particularly those with adaptive laser vision capabilities — is significantly enhancing operational precision, efficiency, and worker safety.

## Market Introduction

Offshore welding supports the construction, repair, and ongoing maintenance of vital offshore energy infrastructure, including oil rigs and subsea pipelines. Welding types used include:
- **On-board welding**
- **Dry dock welding**
- **Underwater welding**

Among technologies employed in underwater welding are:
- **Arc welding**
- **Resistance welding**
- **Oxy-fuel welding**
- **Laser welding**

Modern trends emphasize automation. Robotic welding and automatic systems are increasingly favored to meet high precision requirements and operate under challenging offshore conditions.

### Preferred Welding Techniques
Two prominent techniques gaining traction include:

- **Flux-Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)**: Known for high wire deposition rates and arc stability. Carbon dioxide is the shielding gas of choice, offering deep weld penetration at lower costs.

- **Submerged Arc Welding (SAW)**: Offers deep penetration, minimal arc light, and reduced fumes — ideal for thick materials in marine environments.

## Market Drivers

### 1. Rise in Investment in Oil & Gas Infrastructure

Growing energy demand has spurred development in oil & gas infrastructure. According to *Our World in Data*, global energy consumption rose from 122,000 TWh in 2000 to 173,000 TWh in 2019.

In early 2024, India’s Vedanta announced a **US$ 4 Bn investment** aimed at doubling its oil production capacity to 300,000 barrels/day, demonstrating the sector’s commitment to expansion.

### 2. Surge in Robotic Welding Adoption

Repair and maintenance activities are crucial in preventing corrosion and ensuring system integrity offshore. Robotic welding systems offer speed, repeatability, and safety. Equipped with sensors and AI, these systems operate efficiently in environments hazardous to humans.

**Case in Point**: In 2023, **Comau** and **Fincantieri** unveiled *MR4WELD* — a mobile robotic welding system optimized for shipbuilding and adaptable to various sectors, further validating industry interest in robotic solutions.

## Regional Outlook

### North America Leads the Market

North America accounted for the largest market share in 2023, driven by a mature oil & gas industry and increasing natural gas output.

- The U.S. has over **500,000 producing wells** and more than **4,000 offshore rigs**.
- In 2022, U.S. dry natural gas production hit a record **36.35 trillion cubic feet**, averaging 96.6 billion cubic feet/day.

This robust infrastructure underpins the region’s continued dominance in offshore welding activities.

## Competitive Landscape

Leading players are innovating with durable, low-hydrogen welding consumables and automation technologies to serve offshore environments.

### Key Companies:
- **ESAB**
- **Lincoln Electric**
- **Miller Electric Mfg. LLC**
- **Fronius International GmbH**
- **Hypertherm Inc.**

These firms focus on providing end-to-end solutions — from filler materials to robotic welding platforms — catering to upstream, midstream, and downstream oil & gas segments.

## Key Developments

- **Feb 2024**: **Alleima** launched *SAF 3007*, a super-duplex stainless steel grade for subsea umbilicals, outperforming the SAF 2507 in deepwater environments.
- **2022**: **Express Engineering** invested significantly in advanced precision welding systems to bolster its offshore equipment capabilities.
