### Understanding Progressing Cavity Pumps

Progressing cavity pumps, also known as PC pumps or screw pumps, are positive displacement pumps designed to transfer fluids with high viscosity and abrasiveness. The technology relies on a rotor that revolves inside a stator or fixed chamber, creating sealed cavities that move fluid steadily from inlet to outlet. This design makes them particularly well-suited for handling challenging substances such as sludge, slurry, and abrasive fluids that might otherwise damage conventional pumps.

These pumps are widely used in industries requiring precise flow control of viscous and abrasive liquids, including food and beverage processing, chemical manufacturing, pulp and paper, mining, and especially in oil & gas and water & wastewater treatment.

### Key Drivers of Market Growth

#### Expansion in the Oil & Gas Sector

One of the primary growth drivers for progressing cavity pumps is the expansion of the oil & gas industry. These pumps are extensively used in upstream operations, particularly in exploratory drilling and production processes that involve handling thick and abrasive fluids such as drilling mud, crude oil, and sludge.

In 2022 alone, global oil production averaged 93.9 million barrels per day, with the U.S. contributing 17.8 million barrels daily. The demanding nature of upstream operations has led to increased reliance on progressing cavity pumps for their energy efficiency, reliability, and ability to deliver a constant flow rate despite varying fluid characteristics. The use of progressive cavity metering pumps in oil & gas not only optimizes performance but also reduces maintenance costs and operational downtime, further driving market adoption.

#### Rising Investment in Wastewater Treatment

Environmental concerns and water scarcity have intensified focus on wastewater treatment infrastructure globally. Progressive cavity pumps are vital in wastewater management due to their capacity to move thick, abrasive waste-activated sludge and other high-viscosity materials commonly found in treatment plants.

With over 40% of the world’s population living in areas under severe water stress, the need to treat and recycle water is critical. Countries are increasingly investing in advanced wastewater treatment and desalination projects to secure clean water for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use. For instance, Saudi Arabia announced over 60 new water treatment projects at the 2022 MENA Desalination Projects Forum, expected to triple its desalination capacity by 2027.

This growing focus on water treatment infrastructure is significantly boosting demand for progressing cavity pumps capable of withstanding harsh wastewater environments and managing solids without clogging.

### Regional Market Outlook

Asia Pacific currently dominates the progressing cavity pumps market, holding the largest share as of 2022. This leadership position stems from rapid economic development, urbanization, and industrialization across countries like China and India, alongside increased agricultural activities requiring efficient water and wastewater management solutions.

Additionally, the region has witnessed expanded shale exploration and production efforts. For example, India’s Cairn Oil & Gas, a subsidiary of Vedanta Ltd., received approval in late 2022 to extend production contracts for its Rajasthan block until 2030, underscoring growing upstream activities that drive pump demand.

Other regions such as North America and Europe also contribute significantly, supported by mature oil & gas industries and strict environmental regulations prompting investments in wastewater treatment upgrades.
