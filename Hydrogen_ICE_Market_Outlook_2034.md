## Market Drivers

### 1. Surge in Launch of Hydrogen-powered Trucks

Major automakers are increasingly embracing hydrogen ICEs for their ability to deliver power and range comparable to diesel engines—without the carbon emissions. A notable example includes:

- **MAN Truck & Bus** announced the **MAN hTGX**, a limited series of hydrogen-powered trucks, with production starting in 2025. Approximately 200 units are planned for markets in Germany, Norway, Iceland, and beyond.

Such initiatives are expected to dramatically scale the market and improve public and commercial sector adoption of hydrogen-powered transportation.

### 2. Shift Toward Clean Energy Solutions

The harmful environmental impact of fossil fuels has led countries worldwide to seek clean alternatives. Hydrogen, which produces zero carbon emissions when combusted or used in a fuel cell, is gaining favor. According to climate projections, global temperatures could rise **by 2.7°F by 2050**, underscoring the urgency of clean energy transitions.

- In **May 2024**, the **European Commission** awarded **€720 Mn** to seven renewable hydrogen projects.
- The **U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)** allocated **US$ 7 Bn** to develop seven hydrogen hubs across the United States.

These massive investments are accelerating the pace of development and commercialization of hydrogen technologies, including ICEs.
